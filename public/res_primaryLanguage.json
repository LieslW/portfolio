      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Liesl White and I am a Software Developer in  full stack JavaScript. I came from a university with a major in Wildlife Conservation and Management. However, this did not challenge or interest me as I thought it would so I looked for other career paths and stumbled upon software development through a family member. I still have a passion for conservation efforts from my previous studies and I believe I can still contribute to non-profit efforts using my skills as a software developer. I bring a lot of team management skills and utilization of positive customer engagement to promote my core company. My strengths rely on attention to detail, creative thinking, and my ability to adapt a plan of action to any given situation. The goal for myself is to build a foundation in the tech field not only using the skills Code Fellows will provide me but also from my growing network. I want to be able to use what I learn in order to facilitate data structures and applications for the user and possibly inspire them with a message.",
